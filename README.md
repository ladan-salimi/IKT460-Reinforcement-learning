# Reinforcement-learning
This project explores the application of reinforcement learning in the 20 Questions game as a structured environment for evaluating dialogue systems and knowledge acquisition. The study initially implements the Reinforce algorithm for question-driven word guessing and extends the approach by integrating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to compare their effectiveness. We also introduce a novel approach that was proposed for the first time in this study. It involves training an RL agent to ask questions in a human-interpretable format (e.g., "Does it have feathers?") generated by the T5-Small language model. The agent learns to refine its questioning strategy using REINFORCE-driven reinforcement learning, selecting the most informative questions at each step.
